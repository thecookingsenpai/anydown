# What's this

Anydown is a software that automates the deployment and the remote access on computers using AnyDesk.

# How does it works

Anydown downloads, install and set up AnyDesk in a breeze, without interaction needed.

Then, the software send the credentials to a Telegram account using a bot.

# How to set up the Telegram connection

In the source code (when I will publish id), there's my publicy available bot (that could disappear suddendly and can be viewed or modified by anyone running the anygen.exe binary file, so I strongly advise you to create a bot and change that line in the source code).

So, you can just simply start AnyGen.exe and follow instructions: this will generate a 7zip SFX silent bundle associated with your Telegram chat with the chosen bot.

# How to use

When you generated the bundle, just start it on the PC you want to set up.

# Disclaimer and what you can't do

This software has been created to help people to set up remote connections using AnyDesk for legitimate purposes only. It's useful to quickly set up connections (for example with your customers) without struggling into configurations and misunderstandings. You can simply let your customer execute the bundle and you are ready to assist him or her quickly. 

I am not responsible if someone decides to use this software for illicit purposes, this is NOT ALLOWED and STRONGLY prohibited.
